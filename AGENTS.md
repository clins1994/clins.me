# Project Instructions

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all new UI styling.
- Prefer utility classes in Astro components/pages instead of adding new global CSS selectors.
- Use the Tailwind Typography plugin (`prose`) for markdown-heavy views like resumes, docs, and posts.
- Only extend `src/styles/global.css` for shared base styles that cannot be expressed cleanly with utilities.
